  bio: "I graduated from St.-Petersburg State University in Computational Physics. I used to do some research in mathematics but my favourite subject is functional programming. Right now I am a senior analyst and data scientist in a social network ok.ru. I am also an experienced Apache Spark user. 4 years ago I encountered a probabilistic programming for the first time. The main goal of my talk is to give a review of this facinating subject for the wider audience."
